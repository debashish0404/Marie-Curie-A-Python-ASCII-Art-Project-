# Marie Curie ASCII Art Generator

-> Project Overview
This project generates an ASCII art portrait of the scientist Marie Curie using Python.
The portrait is created using special characters to represent different intensity levels.
Only basic Python concepts such as loops and conditional statements are used.

-> Technologies Used
- Python 3
- VS Code

-> How the Code Works
1. The ASCII pattern is defined using special characters.
2. Loops are used to print each line of the pattern.
3. Conditional statements manage spacing and structure.
4. Dark areas are shown using characters like # and @.
5. Light areas are shown using dots and spaces.

-> How to Run the Project
1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open the project folder in VS Code.
3. Open the terminal.
4. Run:
   python marie_curie.py

-> Output
The program displays a text-based ASCII art portrait of Marie Curie in the terminal.
